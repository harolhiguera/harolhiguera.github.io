               <h3>Java</h3>
               <p>Java was the first language I learnt that would turn my passion to mobile development. Now, being
                  involved in this Industry I had the privilege to get involved in enterprise sort of application to
                  build back-end services. I have a proficient level in java application with Spring Boot, JPA and
                  Hibernate. I can integrate any other third party, assign security configurations, work with relational
                  and non-relational databases, create APIs for mobile clients, document APIS, run Unit Tests, choose
                  the more appropriate infrastructure and design the entire architecture for an application based on
                  business the model required.</p>
